# Homework 4

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to present the user with a user interface that queries the index table and ranking algorithm and display the results in a sorted fashion.  Most likely your team will display the results of the search in page rank order.

## Coding

Your team will use maven `tomcat` plugin.  Ultimately you should code up a simple HTML form and a `post` end point that displays the results of the search.  To run the search interface, execute:

```
mvn tomcat:run
```
At this point we only needs to point a web browser to `http://localhost:8080` or a port of your choosing.

## Grading 

Your team will be graded as followed:

1. The results are displayed in a ranked order.
2. Make sure that you pick out a website that you can test the search engine code against
