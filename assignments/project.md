# Final Project

## Objective

The goal of the project is to demonstrate that your team has put together a fully functional search engine from start to finish.

## Coding

Your project must be coded in Java using maven.  Your code should be clean and free of warnings.  Your code should work seemlessly.  

## Grading 

The project is worth 15% of your overall grade.  To be clear the final project will be graded along the following criteria (each criteria is worth 3 points):

1. Presentation: does your project look good?
   a) low -- just plain ugly
   b) medium -- acceptable
   c) high -- gorgeous

2. Clean Code: does your code compile clean and free of warnings and errors?
   a) true -- everything compiles cleanly
   b) false -- visible error and warning messsages

3. Ranking algorithm: Your own ranking function
   a) low -- not implemented or yield constant results
   b) medium -- sorta working
   c) high -- well thoughtout and implemented

4. Collaborative: did your team work together?
   a) low -- one person does all the work, last minute commit on github
   b) medium -- shared work but last minute commit
   c) high -- continuous and equal commits by all parties

5. Correctness: are your search results correct?
   a) low -- nothing makes sense
   b) medium -- works but it does always yield the correct search result
   c) high -- everything works as expected
