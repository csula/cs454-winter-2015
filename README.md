## Search Engines Information Retrieval in Practice

Please refer to the [syllabus](https://github.com/csula/cs454-winter-2015/blob/master/Syllabus.md) for more information about the course.  

## Homework 1

The focus of this homework assignment is **crawling**.  Write a program that crawls the Internet given a seed URL.  Your crawler program will need crawling guidance.

## Homework 2

Once the information has been crawled and locally stored, meta information must be extracted.  Thus this assignment focuses **extraction**.  Write a program that extracts information from the crawled data from assignment 1.

## Homework 3

The process of **indexing and ranking** involves taking explicited and implicitedly obtained metadata and stored them in a "database" for faster recall.  Most importantly, we are concerned with how to organize information such that the "intent" of the users is correctly met.  Write a program that ranks the data collected from assignment 1 and the extracted meta information from assignment 2.

## Homework 4

Building a "Query Interface" is the provisioning a simple mechanism to search and present the hierarchical information retrieved.  Write a _command line_ interface and a _web enabled_ interface that is based on indexed and ranked information collected in assignment 3.

## Final Project

Your final project is consisted of putting together a complete information retrieval system.  This **search engine** is combining all of your previous programming assignments into a suite of applications.  Note that a search engine system is not necessarily a single program.
