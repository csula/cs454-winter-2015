# Search Engines Information Retrieval in Practice

**Objective** This course will cover web search engines and their foundation, principles, and elements.

**Expection** The class will include lectures on topics relating specifically to search engine technologies and on supplemental paper reading assignments. 

## Course Logistics

**Instructor** John J. Tran

**Lecture** Saturday 1:20 PM - 5:00 PM ET A309

**Office Hours** Saturday 5:15 PM - 6:15 PM or by appointment

**Text Book** _Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice_ by Bruce Croft, Donald Metzler, and Trevor Strohman. ISBN: 978-0136072249.  Can be obtained from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Search-Engines-Information-Retrieval-Practice/dp/0136072240) or the CSULA book store.

## Grading Allocation

There will be 4 quizzes that are based on textbook and papers. The course will also include 4 programming assignments and a final project.

1. Quiz - 20 points
2. Homework - 60 points
3. Project - 15 points
4. Class Participation - 5 points

**Final Project** These homework assignments culminate a final project: a fully functional search engine. Students will engage in a team or individual project to leverage the search engine techniques learned during the course (e.g., ranking, crawling, content analysis and detection, and query models). **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**
