# Search Engines Information Retrieval in Practice

## Course Overview

- **Objective** This course will cover web search engines and their foundation, principles, and elements.
- **Expection** The class will include lectures on topics relating to search engine technologies and on supplemental paper reading assignments.  Programming assignments will augment theoretical aspects of information retrieval.  **Please understand that this is a graduate-level/upper division engineering course. Please plan on devoting a large amount of time to the programming assignments and course project.**

## Course Logistics

- **Instructor** John J. Tran
- **Lecture** Saturday 1:20 PM - 5:00 PM @ ET A309
- **Office Hours** Saturday 5:15 PM - 6:15 PM or by appointment
- **Text Book** _Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice_ by Bruce Croft, Donald Metzler, and Trevor Strohman. ISBN: 978-0136072249.  Can be obtained from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Search-Engines-Information-Retrieval-Practice/dp/0136072240) or the CSULA book store.

## Grading Allocation

There will be 4 quizzes that are based on textbook and papers. The course will also include 4 programming assignments and a final project.

1. Quiz - 20 points
2. Homework - 60 points
3. Project - 15 points
4. Class Participation - 5 points

**Final Project** These homework assignments culminate a final project: a fully functional search engine. Students will engage in a team or individual project to leverage the search engine techniques learned during the course (e.g., ranking, crawling, content analysis and detection, and query models). **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**
