## Objective

Write a java crawler that crawls the web for data.  The crawler pulls data and stores it locally.  The crawler will not do any analysis on the data.

## Coding

Use maven and java to write the crawler.  Your crawler should be executed as followed:

```
java -jar crawler.jar -d <depth> -u <url> 
```

Depth is how many level (links) deep your crawler will execute a crawl before returning.  Url can be any url from which it will crawl.  

The craw should save data to a local storage.  The implementation of the storage layer is open to your option.

## Grading 

Your team will be graded as followed:

1. Crawling correctness
2. Storage of data to local site
